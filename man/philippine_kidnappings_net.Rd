Data refers to the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), a violent non-state actor operating
in the Southern Philippines. In particular, this data is related to the Salast
movement that has been founded by Aburajak Janjalani, a native terrorist of the
Southern Philippines in 1991. ASG is active in kidnapping and other kinds of
terrorist attacks (Gerdes et al. 2014). The reconstructed 2-mode matrix
combines terrorist kidnappers and the terrorist events they have attended.
