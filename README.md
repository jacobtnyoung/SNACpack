## Installation  

To install SNACpack from GitHub:

```r
# install devtools (if not already installed)
install.packages( "devtools" )  

# install the package from the Github repository
devtools::install_github( "jacobtnyoung/SNACpack" )
```

---

## Example Usage  

```r

# load the library for SNACpack
library( SNACpack )

```

`SNACpack` includes multiple networks for the user. The data are objects of class `network`, so you need to install the `network` package.

```r

install.packages( "network" )
library( network )

```

Now, you can look at the data objects. For example, `SNACpack` includes data from Mangia Natarajanâ€™s study of a large cocaine trafficking organization in New York City. The network is directed, binary ties of communication between individuals collected from police wiretaps of telephone conversations. This network is named `cocaine_dealing_net`.

```r

# examine the help page for the network
?cocaine_dealing_net

# print it out to see the features
cocaine_dealing_net

```
